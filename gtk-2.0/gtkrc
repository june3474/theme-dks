# This is the GTK+ 2 version of Adwaita. It's whole purpose is to look as the
# GTK+ 3 version as much as possible until GTK+ 2 dies completely.

# widget matches.

# Declare the colours used throughout the theme.
# There shouldn't be any fiddling with them in the theme files themselves in
# order to not mess up the dark theme.
